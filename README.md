# Frontend Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning and becoming a full-stack developer. It includes various projects and applications that I build as I learn new technologies and improve my skills.

## About

This repository serves as a personal portfolio and a log of my progress. You can follow my journey and see the different projects I'm working on.

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

-   **vanilla**: A simple application built with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
-   **vue**: A more complex application built with the Vue.js framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, navigate to the project's directory and follow the instructions in its respective `README.md` file.

```bash
cd apps/<project-name>
```

## Contributing

Since this is a personal learning journey, I am not actively seeking contributions. However, feel free to open an issue if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement.
